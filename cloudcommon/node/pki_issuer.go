// Three intermediate certificates are used to issue certificates to services.

// To avoid services from one region to be able to talk to services from

// must be tagged with the region in the URI SANs, of the form region://<name>.
// Vault issuing roles are used to ensure that services from one region
// can only add a URI SAN from their own region. Regions are verified by
// the custom verification function on the tls config.
